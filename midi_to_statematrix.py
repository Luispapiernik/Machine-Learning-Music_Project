    input:
      midifile(str): standart midi file; this format is desired in order to
        have a music metric into account for the training, also it contains
        what are called values in music.
    ouput:
      statematrix(list): list of dimensions (n_1/16, n_notes, bool[2]).
        n_1/16: number of times covered sampling in 1/16 of a round, e. g.:
          if a midi file has only a black it n_1/16 = 4.
        n_notes: The number of notes to be taken into account in a given scale,
          this one is given by upperBound - lowerBound. In this when Sol key
          40(in idx) is designated for MI. Bug: the program does not count
          notes out of the  range and could put subsequent notes that are not;
          please verify range approipately.
        bool[]: its first value in statematrix[i_1/16, i_note] says if the note
          was played in that time, the second one if it was articilated at that
          time. Then an eight La would have values statematrix[i, La_number] =
          [1, 1] and then statematrix[i + 1, La_number] = [0, 1]
